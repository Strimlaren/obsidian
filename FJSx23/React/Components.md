### What is it?
Components are the core way of structuring code with React. Instead of handling everything in huge files, a kind of separation of concerns is implemented. This way is an extension of the import/export and module functionality built-in inside JavaScript and the mind-set when coding in this manner is very similar.

### What is a component?
A React component is a reusable piece of UI (User Interface) that encapsulates certain functionality and rendering logic. It can be a simple element like a button or a complex element like a form or a navigation bar. Components can manage their own state and properties, making them independent and modular building blocks in React applications.
