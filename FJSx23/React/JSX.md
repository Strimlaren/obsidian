### What is it?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe the UI components. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize the structure of UI components. This JSX code is then transformed into regular JavaScript code by tools like Babel before being executed in the browser.
