Part of [[HTML]]
### What is it?
The use of semantic tags instead of non-semantic tags for the purpose of creating more easily readable and relevant code for humans and machines alike. This is done by purposefully using tags that show the meaning of the content to follow.

Instead of using non semantic tags that dont say anything about the type of content..

```html
<div>
	<div>Article text here</div>
</div>
```

..semantics say we should use tags that accurately describe the content:

```html
<section>
	<article>Article text here</article>
</section>
```
