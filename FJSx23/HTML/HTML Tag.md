Part of [[HTML]]
### What is it?
HTML Tags looks like this..

```html
<html>
```

.. and they usually come in pairs;

```html
<article>
	<div>
		<p>Text</p>
	</div>
</article>
```

While some tags, like `<img>` and `<video>`  dont need a closing tag. The ending `/` is optional.

```html 
<img src="link/address" />
```
