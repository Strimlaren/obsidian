Part of [[HTML]]
### What is it?
In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: 

```html
<p>Starting tag + content + ending tag makes up an HTML element</p>
```

The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.

More specifically, an element consists of:
1. Opening [[HTML Tag]]
2. [[HTML Attribute]](s)
3. Value(s)
4. (Content)
5. Ending [[HTML Tag]]

```html
<openingTag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">Content</endingTag>
```
