Part of [[HTML]]
### What is it?
HTML is a Markup language, which means it is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts, and these parts together have a common name, Markup.

Parts that make up the HTML markup:
- [[HTML Tag]]
- [[HTML Element]]
- [[HTML Attribute]]
### Presentational Markup
The difference between 

```html
<b>Bold Text</b>  

and 

<strong>Bold Text</strong>
```

is purely for screen readers, and [[Semantics|semantic]] in nature. While both tags give the same result to screen, aural devices and screen readers will not be able to interpret the tags and understand how this content is to be emphasized.
