### What is it?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server side, outside of a web browser. Here are some key points about Node.js:
- **JavaScript on the Server**: Enables running JavaScript on the server, not just in the browser.
- **Built on V8 Engine**: Uses Google's V8 engine, which is also used by Chrome, for fast execution of JavaScript.
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Employs an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and scalable for handling many simultaneous connections.
- **Package Ecosystem**: Comes with npm (Node Package Manager), a large ecosystem of open-source libraries and modules.
