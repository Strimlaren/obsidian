### The Ternary Operator
Is a shorthand if statement that can be inserted inside expressions thanks to its simplicity:

```javascript
const age = 22;
const drink = age >= 18 ? "Vodka" : "Milk";
```

Can be used as expressions like so:

```javascript
const age = 17;
console.log(`I like to drink ${age >= 18 ? "Vodka" : "Milk"}`);
```
