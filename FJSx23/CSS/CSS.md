### What is it?
CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets** and is what makes the look and feel of a website, like font, text size, colors, animations etc. It is possible to create websites without CSS but they would be unmodern, ugly and a lot less functional. It allows for the separation between content and presentation.
