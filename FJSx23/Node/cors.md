### What is it?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows or restricts web applications on different domains from communicating with your server. In Express, the `cors` middleware is used to specify which domains are permitted to access resources, enhancing security by limiting unauthorized requests.
