### What is it?
Helmet is a middleware for Express.js that helps secure applications by setting various HTTP headers, such as `Content-Security-Policy` and `Strict-Transport-Security`. This reduces common web vulnerabilities, such as XSS (cross-site scripting) and clickjacking, making the app more secure.
