### What is it?
With Node, it is possible to use JavaScript as a backend. It is a RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT that converts JavaScript code into machine code. Another example of what a  runtime environment is, is browsers. They are local runttime environments and sport an engine as well as built in APIs like fetch. When serverside programming, that runtime is instead Node, and sports an engine of its own, and a offera a different set of core APIs. It is used for server-side programming and implements asynchronous execution of tasks which makes Node applications much faster.

- Node.js is an open source server environment.
- Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
- Single-threaded, nonblocking, asynchronous programming.
- Node.js can generate dynamic page content.
- Node.js can create/delete/read/write/open/close files on server.
- Node.js can collect form data.
- Node.js can add/delete/modify data in your database.
### What is a Node.js File?
- Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events.
- A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server.
- Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect.
- Node.js files have extension ".js".
### What is NPM?
NPM stands for Node Package Manager. NPM is a Command line utility to install Node.js packages, perform version management and dependency management of Node.js packages.
