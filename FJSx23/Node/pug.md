### What is it?
Alternative views engine with different syntax. Allows for shorter and cleaner html with different syntax rules from EJS and regular HTML, however does not allow javascript inside html. To stay with the clean code principle, PUG expects you to handle all js conditionals you could be needing for your conditional rendering back in your handler function that calls the .render( ) and expects you to only send boolean values for the rendering. Allows for better handling of templates.
